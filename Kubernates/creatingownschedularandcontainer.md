1️⃣ Can I create my own Scheduler?

✅ Yes!
Kubernetes is highly extensible — you can write and run custom schedulers alongside (or instead of) the default one.

🔑 How it works:
The Scheduler’s job is to:
Watch for Pods without a Node (spec.nodeName is empty)
Decide which Node to assign based on your custom logic (e.g. cost, GPU, energy efficiency)
Bind the Pod to the chosen Node by calling the API Server.
Kubernetes supports multiple Schedulers:
You can deploy your custom Scheduler as a Pod.
To tell a Pod which Scheduler to use, set:
spec:
  schedulerName: my-custom-scheduler
📌 Example use cases:
Custom cost-based scheduling.
GPU or FPGA resource aware placement.
Priority for on-prem vs cloud nodes.
✅ Many companies build custom Schedulers for special needs!

2️⃣ Can I create my own Controller Manager?

✅ Yes, but with a caveat.
The kube-controller-manager is the official binary that runs many built-in controllers (like ReplicationController, NodeController, etc).
You can’t easily replace individual built-in controllers in that binary — but you can:

✅ Write your own controllers:
Using client-go, Kubebuilder, or Operator SDK.
Custom controllers watch for specific API objects and take action to reconcile desired state.
✅ Run them as separate Pods:
They can live alongside the default kube-controller-manager.
✅ Disable built-in controllers:
You could run your own custom controller for the same resource type — but this is advanced and must be done carefully.
📌 Common use cases for custom controllers:
Automate cluster tasks (e.g. dynamic config, auto-labeling nodes)
Implement Operators (e.g. automatic database backups)
Custom resource controllers (CRDs)
