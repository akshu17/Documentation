# 📌 Stateful vs Stateless Applications in Kubernetes

## ✅ What is a Stateless Application?

- Does **not store** any session or client data between requests.
- Each request is independent.
- Any replica can handle any request.
- Easy to scale horizontally.
- Highly fault-tolerant: you can add/remove Pods freely.
- **Examples:** REST APIs, web servers serving static files.

**Kubernetes:** Use `Deployment`.

## ✅ What is a Stateful Application?

- Maintains **state** across requests (session, data, etc.).
- Requires stable network identity and often persistent storage.
- Pods are **not interchangeable** — each has a unique identity.
- Scaling and upgrades require careful handling (data replication, ordered operations).
- **Examples:** Databases (MySQL, Cassandra), message brokers (Kafka), Redis with persistence.

**Kubernetes:** Use `StatefulSet` and `PersistentVolumes`.

## 🔑 Key Differences

| Feature          | Stateless          | Stateful                |
| ---------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Pod Identity     | Any Pod, same config | Unique & stable         |
| Storage          | Ephemeral           | Persistent volumes      |
| Scaling          | Easy, horizontal    | Careful, ordered        |
| K8s Resource     | Deployment          | StatefulSet             |

## ✅ When to Use

| Use case | Stateless | Stateful |
| -------- | --------- | -------- |
| Web/API server | ✅ | ❌ |
| Database | ❌ | ✅ |
| Message broker | ❌ | ✅ |
| In-memory cache | ✅ (if ephemeral) | ✅ (if persistent) |

## 🚀 Tip

Use **Deployments** for stateless applications and **StatefulSets** for stateful workloads needing stable network identity and storage.

Happy Kubernetes-ing! 🎉
