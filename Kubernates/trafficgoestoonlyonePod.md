# üê≥ Kubernetes Troubleshooting: Traffic Goes to Only One Pod

## ‚úÖ Scenario
- You created a Deployment.
- It created **2 Pods**.
- Both Pods show as **Running**.
- But your Service sends traffic to only one Pod.

---

## ‚úÖ Possible Causes

| Cause | Explanation |
| --- | --- |
| **1Ô∏è‚É£ Readiness probe failing** | If a Pod's readiness probe fails, it won't receive traffic even if `Running`. |
| **2Ô∏è‚É£ Missing Endpoints** | The Service Endpoints may list only one Pod IP. |
| **3Ô∏è‚É£ Network Policy or firewall** | Could block traffic to a specific Pod. |
| **4Ô∏è‚É£ Pod unhealthy** | Pod may be Running but app inside may be broken. |
| **5Ô∏è‚É£ Session Affinity** | Service uses `sessionAffinity: ClientIP`, so same client always talks to the same Pod. |
| **6Ô∏è‚É£ Local traffic policy** | Service is configured to send traffic only to Pods on the same Node (`externalTrafficPolicy: Local`). |

## ‚úÖ How to Troubleshoot

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Check Pod readiness
```bash
kubectl get pods -o wide
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
Look at READY column: should be 1/1.
Check Events for readiness probe failures.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Check Service Endpoints
Always show details

kubectl get svc
kubectl describe svc <service-name>
kubectl get endpoints <service-name>
Ensure both Pod IPs are listed as Endpoints.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Check Pod logs
Always show details

kubectl logs <pod-name>
Look for errors, crashes, or failed health checks.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Check session affinity
Always show details

kubectl get svc <service-name> -o yaml | grep sessionAffinity
If ClientIP, same client always uses same Pod.
5Ô∏è‚É£ Check network policies
Always show details

kubectl get networkpolicy
Ensure no policy blocks Pod-to-Pod or Service traffic.
