# üìå How Two Containers Can Share Information in Kubernetes

## ‚úÖ Context

In Kubernetes, you often want multiple containers to work together **inside the same Pod** ‚Äî for example, a main application and a helper.

Pods allow containers to share:
- **Network namespace:** same localhost, same IP.
- **Storage volumes:** shared file system.

## ‚úÖ Ways to Share Information

| Method | How it Works | When to Use |
| ------ | ------------- | ------------ |
| 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Shared Volume** | Containers mount the same volume. Read/write files to exchange data. | For file-based data sharing |
| 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Local Network** | One container exposes an API on `localhost`, another container calls it. | For request/response, APIs |
| 3Ô∏è‚É£ **IPC / Unix Sockets** | Containers share a file-based socket (e.g., `/tmp/app.sock`). | For local IPC without TCP overhead |

## ‚úÖ Example 1 ‚Äî Shared Volume

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: shared-pod
spec:
  volumes:
    - name: shared-data
      emptyDir: {}
  containers:
    - name: writer
      image: writer-app
      volumeMounts:
        - name: shared-data
          mountPath: /shared
    - name: reader
      image: reader-app
      volumeMounts:
        - name: shared-data
          mountPath: /shared
```

**How it works:**
- `emptyDir` is a temporary shared storage.
- Both containers mount it at `/shared`.
- They can read/write files in the same place.

## ‚úÖ Example 2 ‚Äî Local Network (localhost)

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: api-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: api-server
      image: my-api
      ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
    - name: api-client
      image: my-client
      # The client can call http://localhost:8080
```

**How it works:**
- Both containers share the same IP.
- `api-server` listens on `localhost:8080`.
- `api-client` sends requests to `http://localhost:8080`.

---

## ‚úÖ Key Points

- **Inside a Pod:** containers share network and storage by design.
- **Between Pods:** use Kubernetes Services to communicate.
- **Best practice:** Use multiple containers in a Pod only if they are tightly coupled (like sidecars).

---

## üöÄ Summary

| Scenario | How to Share |
| -------- | -------------- |
| **Same Pod** | Use shared volumes or localhost |
| **Different Pods** | Use Kubernetes Services |

‚úÖ **Common examples:** logging sidecars, data processing helpers, or proxies.
