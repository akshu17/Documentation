# Kubernetes Interview Questions & Answers: ConfigMap and Secrets

---

## üî∑ Section 1: ConfigMap

### 1. What is a ConfigMap in Kubernetes?

A ConfigMap is a Kubernetes object used to store non-sensitive key-value pairs. It's typically used to externalize configuration data such as environment variables, file names, or command-line arguments.

---

### 2. How do you create a ConfigMap?

- From literals:
  ```bash
  kubectl create configmap my-config --from-literal=APP_MODE=production
  ```
- From file:
  ```bash
  kubectl create configmap my-config --from-file=config.txt
  ```
- From YAML:
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: ConfigMap
  metadata:
    name: my-config
  data:
    APP_MODE: "production"
  ```

---

### 3. How can you use a ConfigMap in a Pod?

- As environment variables:
  ```yaml
  envFrom:
  - configMapRef:
      name: my-config
  ```
- As mounted files via a volume.

---

### 4. Can ConfigMap values be updated? Will it reflect in running pods?

Yes, ConfigMap values can be updated. However, running Pods will not reflect the new values unless restarted or reloaded.

---

### 5. Is ConfigMap namespaced?

Yes, ConfigMaps are namespace-scoped and can only be used by resources in the same namespace unless explicitly referenced.

---

### 6. What are some use cases of ConfigMap?

- Injecting app settings or configuration
- Storing command-line args or file-based configs
- Supporting multi-environment deployments

---

## üî∑ Section 2: Secrets

### 1. What is a Secret in Kubernetes?

A Secret is a Kubernetes object used to store sensitive data like passwords, tokens, and SSH keys. It is base64-encoded and optionally encrypted in etcd.

---

### 2. How do you create a Secret?

- From literals:
  ```bash
  kubectl create secret generic db-creds --from-literal=username=admin --from-literal=password=secret123
  ```
- From YAML:
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Secret
  metadata:
    name: db-creds
  type: Opaque
  data:
    username: YWRtaW4=     # base64 for "admin"
    password: c2VjcmV0MTIz # base64 for "secret123"
  ```

---

### 3. How do you use a Secret in a Pod?

- As environment variables:
  ```yaml
  env:
  - name: DB_USER
    valueFrom:
      secretKeyRef:
        name: db-creds
        key: username
  ```
- As mounted files using volumes.

---

### 4. Is Kubernetes Secret secure?

Not fully by default. While Secrets are base64-encoded and stored separately in etcd, they need encryption at rest enabled and RBAC controls to be considered secure.

---

### 5. Can you use ConfigMap and Secret together?

Yes. You can use both to inject non-sensitive (ConfigMap) and sensitive (Secret) data into the same Pod for complete configuration.

## üîç Bonus: Difference Between ConfigMap and Secret

| Feature         | ConfigMap         | Secret             |
|-----------------|-------------------|--------------------|
| Use             | Non-sensitive data| Sensitive data     |
| Encoding        | Plaintext         | Base64 (optionally encrypted) |
| Default Type    | Opaque            | Opaque             |
| Storage         | etcd              | etcd               |
| Security        | No built-in encryption | Can be encrypted at rest |
