# 🧠 What is a Native Hypervisor?

A **native hypervisor**, also known as a **Type 1 hypervisor**, is a hypervisor that **runs directly on the physical hardware** (bare metal) *without needing a host operating system*.

## 🛠️ Key Characteristics

| Feature                     | Description |
|----------------------------|-------------|
| **Runs on hardware**       | Installed directly on the bare-metal machine like an operating system. |
| **High performance**       | No host OS overhead leads to better performance and efficiency. |
| **Better security**        | Fewer software layers reduce the attack surface. |
| **Used in enterprises**    | Common in data centers, production environments, and cloud infrastructure. |
| **Manages hardware directly** | Allocates CPU, memory, storage, and I/O directly to virtual machines. |

## 📌 Examples of Native (Type 1) Hypervisors

- **VMware ESXi**
- **Microsoft Hyper-V (Core / Server)**
- **Xen**
- **KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine)** – Integrated with the Linux kernel.
- **Oracle VM Server**

## 🧠 Analogy

A native hypervisor is like a **minimal operating system built specifically to run virtual machines**. There's no desktop or traditional UI—just core functionality for virtualization.

# What is a Hypervisor?

A **Hypervisor**, also known as a **Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM)**, is a software layer that enables the creation, management, and execution of **virtual machines (VMs)**. It allows multiple operating systems (OSes) to run simultaneously on a single physical machine, sharing the same hardware resources.

Each virtual machine operates independently and has its own **virtual CPU, memory, storage, and network interfaces**. The hypervisor is responsible for allocating these resources to each VM and ensuring they do not interfere with each other.

## 🔍 Types of Hypervisors

There are **two main types of hypervisors**:

---

### 1. **Type 1 Hypervisor (Bare-Metal Hypervisor)**

**Definition**:  
A Type 1 hypervisor runs **directly on the host's hardware**. It doesn't require an underlying operating system. This makes it **more efficient** and **secure**, as it has direct access to the hardware.

**Examples**:
- VMware ESXi
- Microsoft Hyper-V (bare-metal mode)
- Xen
- KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine, although it uses Linux, it's often considered close to Type 1)

**Advantages**:
- Better performance due to direct hardware access
- Higher security (minimal attack surface)
- Commonly used in enterprise data centers

**Disadvantages**:
- More complex to set up and manage
- Requires dedicated hardware

---

### 2. **Type 2 Hypervisor (Hosted Hypervisor)**

**Definition**:  
A Type 2 hypervisor runs **on top of an existing operating system**. It acts like an application and relies on the host OS for device drivers and hardware interaction.

**Examples**:
- VMware Workstation
- Oracle VirtualBox
- Parallels Desktop
- QEMU (in some use cases)

**Advantages**:
- Easy to install and use (runs like a normal app)
- Great for personal or development use

**Disadvantages**:
- Slower performance due to the extra OS layer
- Less secure and efficient compared to Type 1

### 🧠 Summary

| Feature            | Type 1 Hypervisor          | Type 2 Hypervisor         |
|--------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|
| Runs on            | Bare-metal (hardware)       | Host Operating System     |
| Performance        | High                        | Moderate                  |
| Use Case           | Enterprise, Data Centers    | Personal, Development     |
| Examples           | VMware ESXi, Hyper-V        | VirtualBox, VMware Workstation |
| Security           | More Secure                 | Less Secure               |
| Ease of Use        | Complex                     | Easy                      |

## ✅ Conclusion

Hypervisors are a critical component of **virtualization technology**, allowing businesses and developers to optimize resource usage, reduce costs, and increase flexibility. Whether you choose a Type 1 or Type 2 hypervisor depends on your **performance needs**, **security requirements**, and **use case**.
