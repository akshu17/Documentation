# 🧠 What is a Native Hypervisor?

A **native hypervisor**, also known as a **Type 1 hypervisor**, is a hypervisor that **runs directly on the physical hardware** (bare metal) *without needing a host operating system*.

## 🛠️ Key Characteristics

| Feature                     | Description |
|----------------------------|-------------|
| **Runs on hardware**       | Installed directly on the bare-metal machine like an operating system. |
| **High performance**       | No host OS overhead leads to better performance and efficiency. |
| **Better security**        | Fewer software layers reduce the attack surface. |
| **Used in enterprises**    | Common in data centers, production environments, and cloud infrastructure. |
| **Manages hardware directly** | Allocates CPU, memory, storage, and I/O directly to virtual machines. |

## 📌 Examples of Native (Type 1) Hypervisors

- **VMware ESXi**
- **Microsoft Hyper-V (Core / Server)**
- **Xen**
- **KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine)** – Integrated with the Linux kernel.
- **Oracle VM Server**

## 🧠 Analogy

A native hypervisor is like a **minimal operating system built specifically to run virtual machines**. There's no desktop or traditional UI—just core functionality for virtualization.
