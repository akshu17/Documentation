# Explanation of `docker run -it ubuntu`

## The Command:

```bash
docker run -it ubuntu
```

This command starts a new Ubuntu container and gives you an interactive shell to work inside it.

## Breakdown of `-it`

`-it` is a combination of two flags:

### `-i` = Interactive

* Keeps the **input stream (STDIN)** open.
* Lets you **type commands into the container**.
* Without `-i`, you wouldn’t be able to interact via the terminal.

### `-t` = TTY (Terminal)

* Allocates a **pseudo-terminal**.
* Makes the container's output look and behave like a regular terminal.
* Without `-t`, the output might be hard to read or interact with.

---

## Summary of `-it` Together

Using `-it` together means:

> “Start the container and give me an interactive terminal so I can work inside it like a normal Linux shell.”

---

## Analogy

* `-i` = You have a keyboard (you can type).
* `-t` = You have a monitor (you can see terminal output clearly).

---

## Example Use

```bash
docker run -it ubuntu
```

This gives you a shell prompt like:

```bash
root@a1b2c3d4e5:/#
```

Now you can run commands inside the container, such as:

```bash
apt update
ls
echo "Hello from container"
```

You're now inside a fully functional Ubuntu shell inside a container.

---

## To Exit the Container

Type:

```bash
exit
```

Or press `Ctrl + D`.
