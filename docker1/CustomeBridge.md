# Custom Bridge in Docker

A **custom bridge network** in Docker allows you to create your own isolated network with specific settings instead of using Dockerâ€™s default bridge. This is useful when you want better control over container networking, like assigning fixed subnets, IP ranges, or enabling container name resolution within the network.

## Why Create a Custom Bridge?

- Isolate groups of containers from others.
- Control IP addressing and subnet.
- Enable automatic DNS resolution (containers can talk by name).
- Customize network driver options.
