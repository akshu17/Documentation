# What is a Dockerfile and How to Use It

## What is a Dockerfile?

A **Dockerfile** is a plain text file that contains a set of instructions on how to build a **Docker image**. Think of it as a recipe for creating a container — it tells Docker what base image to use, what software to install, what files to copy, and what commands to run when the container starts.

### Why use a Dockerfile?

- It automates the process of building Docker images.
- Ensures consistency — every time you build the image, you get the same environment.
- Easy to share and version control your application setup.

- A Dockerfile is a script that contains a series of instructions to build a Docker image. The basic structure typically includes commands to define the base image, copy files, install dependencies, set environment variables, and specify the default command to run.
Here's the typical structure of a Dockerfile:
FROM – defines the base image
LABEL – metadata (optional)
WORKDIR – sets the working directory inside the container
COPY or ADD – copies files from the host to the container
RUN – executes commands during build (e.g., installing dependencies)
ENV – sets environment variables
EXPOSE – declares the port the container will use
CMD or ENTRYPOINT – defines the default command to run

## Basic Structure of a Dockerfile

Here's a very simple example:

```Dockerfile
# Use an official Node.js runtime as the base image
FROM node:14

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json files
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application code
COPY . .

# Expose port 3000
EXPOSE 3000

# Command to run the app
CMD ["node", "app.js"]
```

## How to Use a Dockerfile

### Step 1: Create a Dockerfile

- In your project root, create a file named `Dockerfile` (no extension).
- Write the instructions to build your app’s environment.

### Step 2: Build the Docker Image

Open your terminal in the directory where the Dockerfile is and run:

```bash
docker build -t myapp:1.0 .
```

- `-t myapp:1.0` gives your image a name (`myapp`) and a version tag (`1.0`).
- The `.` means the current directory (where the Dockerfile and app files are).

### Step 3: Run the Docker Container

Once the image is built, you can run a container based on it:

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 myapp:1.0
```

- `-p 3000:3000` maps port 3000 of your local machine to the container's port 3000.
- Now, your app inside the container will be accessible on `http://localhost:3000`.

| Step            | What Happens                         |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------|
| Write Dockerfile | Define environment and setup steps |
| `docker build`  | Creates an image from Dockerfile     |
| `docker run`    | Runs a container from the image      |
