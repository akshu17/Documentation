## What is a Kubernetes Cluster?

A **Kubernetes Cluster** is a set of nodes (machines) used to run containerized applications managed by Kubernetes.

The cluster consists of:

- **Control Plane (Master Node)**: Manages the overall state of the cluster, including scheduling, scaling, and responding to cluster events.
- **Worker Nodes**: Where application workloads (Pods) are actually run.

Each Kubernetes cluster includes the necessary components to:
- Deploy and run containers at scale
- Provide service discovery and load balancing
- Manage configuration and secrets
- Ensure high availability and fault tolerance

### 📌 Key Features of a Kubernetes Cluster:
- **Scalability**: Easily scale applications up or down.
- **Self-healing**: Automatically replaces failed containers.
- **Load balancing**: Distributes network traffic across containers.
- **Rolling updates and rollbacks**: Seamless application updates with zero downtime.
- **Multi-cloud and on-prem support**: Runs consistently across environments.
