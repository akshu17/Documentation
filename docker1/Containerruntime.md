# 🚀 What is a Container Runtime?

A **container runtime** is the low-level software that is responsible for:

- Running containers
- Isolating processes and resources (e.g., CPU, memory, filesystem)
- Managing container lifecycle (start, stop, pause, etc.)

Think of it as the **engine that actually runs the containers**, under the hood.

## 🔧 Key Responsibilities of a Container Runtime

1. **Pulling container images**
2. **Unpacking and mounting the image layers**
3. **Setting up namespaces and cgroups** for isolation
4. **Starting the container process**
5. **Handling container networking and storage**
6. **Communicating with the OS kernel** to enforce limits and isolation

## 🧱 Examples of Container Runtimes

| Runtime            | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| **runc**           | The default low-level runtime for Docker and Kubernetes; part of the OCI spec |
| **containerd**     | A higher-level container runtime used by Docker and Kubernetes (uses runc internally) |
| **CRI-O**          | Lightweight container runtime for Kubernetes (also uses runc) |
| **Docker Engine**  | Full container platform that uses `containerd` and `runc` underneath |
| **gVisor**         | A sandboxed runtime by Google for added security |
| **Kata Containers**| Lightweight VMs to run containers with stronger isolation |
| **Podman**         | Docker-compatible but daemonless container engine, uses `runc` or others |

## 🧬 How They Relate (Stack View)

### Kubernetes Stack

```
[ Kubernetes ]
      ↓
[ CRI-O or containerd ]
      ↓
[ runc or alternative runtime ]
      ↓
[ Linux Kernel: cgroups, namespaces, etc. ]
```

### Docker Stack

```
[ Docker CLI ]
      ↓
[ Docker Engine ]
      ↓
[ containerd ]
      ↓
[ runc ]
```

---

## 🔍 OCI Compliance

- Most modern runtimes follow the **OCI (Open Container Initiative)** spec.
- This ensures compatibility — images built with Docker can run on CRI-O, containerd, etc.

## ✅ Summary

| Term             | What it does                            |
|------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Container Runtime| Software that runs and manages containers |
| Examples         | runc, containerd, CRI-O, gVisor, Podman   |
| Under the hood   | Uses Linux features like cgroups, namespaces |
