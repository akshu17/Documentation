# Can a Container Restart Itself? How to Restart a Container

## Can a container restart itself?

**No, a container cannot restart itself entirely on its own.**  
A container is a running instance of an image, and it doesn’t have the internal ability to restart itself if it crashes or stops. However, container orchestration tools or container runtimes can be configured to restart containers automatically under certain conditions.

## How do containers get restarted?

### 1. Manual restart:

You can manually restart a container using Docker CLI commands:

```bash
docker restart <container_name_or_id>
```bash
This command stops the container (if running) and then starts it again.

### 2. Automatic restart policies:
Docker provides restart policies that help containers restart automatically if they exit or crash. These are set when you run the container:

```bash
docker run --restart=always <image_name>
```bash
Some common restart policies are:

no — Do not automatically restart (default).
on-failure[:max-retries] — Restart only if the container exits with a non-zero status (failure), optionally limiting the number of retries.
always — Always restart the container regardless of the exit status.
unless-stopped — Always restart except if the container is stopped manually.
3. Using orchestration tools (Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, etc.):
When using orchestration platforms like Kubernetes, containers (pods) are monitored and restarted automatically if they fail or crash, according to the specified restartPolicy in the pod spec.

Summary:

Question	Answer
Can container restart itself?	No, it cannot restart itself internally.
How to restart a container?	Use manual commands (docker restart), restart policies (--restart), or orchestration tools to automate restarts.
