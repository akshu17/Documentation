# ARG in Docker

## ðŸ”¹ What is `ARG`?

`ARG` is a Dockerfile instruction used to define **build-time variables**. These variables can be passed to the Docker build process using the `--build-arg` flag and are available **only during the image build**, not in the running container.

|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Scope               | Build-time only (not available after container starts) |
| Default Value       | Can be set in the Dockerfile                     |
| Overridable         | Yes, via `--build-arg` during `docker build`     |
| Visibility          | Not visible inside the container after build     |
