# Java Container Restart Issues

When dealing with **Java container restart issues**, the problem can stem from several areas including resource constraints, application bugs, container configuration, or external dependencies. To help you better, I’ll outline common causes and troubleshooting tips:

## Common Causes of Java Container Restart Issues

1. **Out of Memory (OOM) Errors:**
   - Java apps often run out of heap or native memory.
   - Containers have limited memory; JVM inside the container may not be tuned properly.
   - Check container logs for `java.lang.OutOfMemoryError`.
   - Check Docker or Kubernetes events for OOMKilled status.

2. **Crash Loop / Rapid Restarts:**
   - JVM crashes due to segmentation faults (`SIGSEGV`) or other fatal errors.
   - Application exceptions that cause the JVM process to exit.
   - Misconfigured JVM options or incompatible Java versions.

3. **Health Check Failures:**
   - Liveness/readiness probes in Kubernetes or Docker health checks fail repeatedly.
   - Causes orchestrator to restart the container.

4. **Improper JVM Flags:**
   - Incorrect JVM tuning can cause excessive CPU usage or GC pauses, causing timeouts.
   - Wrong heap sizes or memory limits conflicting with container limits.

5. **External Dependencies Failing:**
   - App waiting on external services (DB, APIs), causing timeouts or deadlocks.
   - The container orchestrator may restart the container thinking it’s unhealthy.

6. **Container or Host-Level Resource Constraints:**
   - CPU throttling or disk I/O bottlenecks.
   - Network failures or DNS resolution issues.
