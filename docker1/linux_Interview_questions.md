# Linux Administration Interview Questions and Answers

### 1. How do you disable swap memory through command line and ensure it is not added to the system?

**Answer:**
Swap memory can be disabled temporarily using the command:

```bash
swapoff -a
```

This turns off all swap partitions immediately. To ensure swap does not get enabled again on reboot, you need to remove or comment out any swap entries in the `/etc/fstab` file. This file contains information about disk partitions and mount points that are mounted at boot time.

### 2. How to make sure that file system doesnâ€™t get mounted upon the reboot?

**Answer:**
To prevent a file system from being mounted on reboot, you should remove or comment out its entry in `/etc/fstab`. This file tells the OS what to mount during the boot process. If a file system is listed here, it will automatically be mounted.

### 3. Have you created a file system and how do you ensure those file systems are available after reboot?

**Answer:**
Yes. After creating a file system using commands like `mkfs.ext4 /dev/xvdf`, it should be mounted using `mount`. To ensure it persists across reboots, add an entry to `/etc/fstab` using either the device path or the UUID obtained using `blkid`.

### 4. After mounting EBS to instance, will it still be available after reboot?

**Answer:**
By default, mounting is not persistent. To make EBS volumes available after reboot, they should be added to `/etc/fstab` with the correct mount point, file system type, and options. Make sure to use UUID for reliability.

### 5. What init levels are implemented in Linux?

**Answer:**
Runlevels determine the state of the machine after boot. Common runlevels include:

* 0: Halt
* 1: Single-user mode (maintenance)
* 2: Multi-user without networking
* 3: Multi-user with networking (default for servers)
* 4: Undefined (custom)
* 5: GUI mode (default for desktops)
* 6: Reboot
  Modern systems use systemd instead of traditional SysV init.

### 6. Command to check the load of the system?

**Answer:**

```bash
uptime
```

This shows the system uptime, number of users, and system load averages over the last 1, 5, and 15 minutes. Load average indicates how many processes are waiting to be executed.

### 7. Command to check usage of memory/RAM of the system?

**Answer:**

```bash
free -h
```

Displays the total, used, and free memory in a human-readable format. Also shows buffer and cache usage.

### 8. Command to check how many CPU cores are there in the system?

**Answer:**

```bash
grep -c ^processor /proc/cpuinfo
```

This command counts the number of logical CPU cores listed in `/proc/cpuinfo`.

### 9. Suppose I have 100 servers, each with username and password. How can I install packages in all those servers remotely without logging in, using a shell script?

**Answer:**
Use a loop with `sshpass` or public key authentication. Here's an example using a list of IPs:

```bash
for server in $(cat servers.txt); do
  sshpass -p 'password' ssh user@$server "sudo apt install -y packagename"
done
```

For a more secure setup, use SSH key-based authentication.

### 10. Using top command, how will you control all running processes?

**Answer:**
When inside `top`, you can:

* Press `k` to kill a process by PID.
* Use `r` to renice a process (change priority).
* Press `Shift + P` to sort by CPU usage.

### 11. Write a shell script to print all alternate lines

**Answer:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
awk 'NR % 2 == 1' filename
```

This script uses `awk` to print every odd-numbered line (i.e., alternate lines).

### 12. Script to sort all files in logs and sort them according to top memory consumption and copy it to another file

**Answer:**

```bash
ps aux --sort=-%mem > sorted_logs.txt
```

This command lists all running processes sorted by memory usage and saves them to a file.

### 13. Explain runlevel commands

**Answer:**

* `runlevel`: Shows the previous and current runlevel.
* `who -r`: Displays the current runlevel.
  Note: With systemd, runlevels are replaced by targets (e.g., `multi-user.target`).

### 14. How do you find complete details of the Linux version you are using?

**Answer:**

```bash
uname -a
cat /etc/os-release
```

These commands show the kernel version, distribution name, version number, and more.

### 15. What does `ps -ef` do?

**Answer:**
Lists all running processes in full-format, showing PID, PPID, user, and command.

### 16. What does `kill -9 processname` do?

**Answer:**
Kills the process forcefully. You generally need the PID:

```bash
kill -9 <PID>
```

### 17. What are `$?`, `$*`, and `$0`?

**Answer:**

* `$?`: Exit code of the last executed command.
* `$*`: All script arguments as a single word.
* `$0`: Name of the script.

### 18. What is SSH?

**Answer:**
SSH (Secure Shell) is a protocol for secure remote login and command execution.

```bash
ssh user@host
```

### 19. What are the port numbers for SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS?

**Answer:**
