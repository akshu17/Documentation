## What is Kubernetes?

Kubernetes (often abbreviated as **K8s**) is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

Originally developed by Google and now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), Kubernetes provides a framework to run distributed systems resiliently.

### Key Features:
- **Automated Rollouts and Rollbacks**: Manage application updates with zero downtime.
- **Service Discovery and Load Balancing**: Automatically assigns IP addresses and DNS names to containers.
- **Self-Healing**: Automatically restarts failed containers, replaces and reschedules them when nodes die.
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Scale applications up or down automatically based on usage.
- **Secret and Configuration Management**: Manage sensitive information without rebuilding container images.

Kubernetes is cloud-agnostic and works with major cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and GCP as well as on-premise environments.
