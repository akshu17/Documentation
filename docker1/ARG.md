# üß© ARG in Docker

## What is `ARG`?

`ARG` is a Dockerfile instruction used to **define variables that are passed at build time**, not at runtime.

> üîß Think of `ARG` as a **build-time variable** ‚Äî it's only available **while building** the image, not inside the running container.

## üõ†Ô∏è Syntax

```dockerfile
ARG variable_name[=default_value]

ARG in Docker

The ARG instruction in Docker allows you to define variables that are passed at build-time. These variables can be used to customize the image during the Docker image build process.

Key Characteristics:
Available only during the image build process
Cannot be accessed after the image is built (i.e., at runtime)
Often used for customizing the build based on external inputs
Syntax
ARG <variable_name>[=<default_value>]
You can define an argument with or without a default value.

Basic Example
Dockerfile:

FROM alpine
ARG GREETING=Hello
RUN echo "$GREETING from Dockerfile"
Build command:

docker build --build-arg GREETING=Hi -t arg-example .
Output:

Hi from Dockerfile
ARG vs ENV
Feature	ARG	ENV
Scope	Build-time only	Available during build and runtime
Accessibility	Not available in the container	Accessible inside the container
Use case	Customizing build process	Configuring container behavior
Use Case: Installing a Specific Package Version
FROM node
ARG NODE_VERSION=20
RUN echo "Installing Node.js version $NODE_VERSION"
Build:

docker build --build-arg NODE_VERSION=18 -t custom-node .
