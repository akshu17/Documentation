# Understanding Docker Image Tags and Renaming Them

## What is an Image Tag?

In the context of **Docker**, an **image tag** is a label used to identify different versions of a Docker image. The typical format of a Docker image reference is:

```
<repository>:<tag>
```

### Examples:

```
nginx:1.25.2
python:3.12
ubuntu:latest
```

* **`nginx`**, **`python`**, **`ubuntu`** are the **image names** (or repositories).
* **`1.25.2`**, **`3.12`**, **`latest`** are the **tags**, which represent versions or specific builds.

If no tag is specified when pulling or running an image, Docker uses the **`latest`** tag by default.

## Can We Rename a Tag?

Strictly speaking, **you can't rename a tag directly**, but you **can retag an image** with a new tag and optionally delete the old tag.

### Retagging an Image

```bash
docker tag myapp:oldtag myapp:newtag
```

This command creates a new tag for the same image.

### Deleting the Old Tag

```bash
docker rmi myapp:oldtag
```

This removes the old tag from your local system (note: the underlying image data isn't deleted if it's still used by another tag).

## Working with Remote Registries

If the image is hosted in a remote registry (like Docker Hub):

1. **Pull** the image (if not already available locally):

   ```bash
   docker pull myregistry/myapp:oldtag
   ```
2. **Tag** it with the new tag:

   ```bash
   docker tag myregistry/myapp:oldtag myregistry/myapp:newtag
   ```
3. **Push** the new tag:

   ```bash
   docker push myregistry/myapp:newtag
   ```
4. Optionally **delete the old tag** from the registry (this step depends on the registry's UI or API).

---

## Summary

* **Image Tag**: A version label for a Docker image.
* **Renaming**: Not directly supported, but you can **retag and delete** the old one.
* Helps in **versioning**, **labeling**, and **reorganizing** your image versions.
