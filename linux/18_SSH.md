# SSH (Secure Shell) - Complete Guide

## 🔑 What Does SSH Do?

SSH enables:

* **Secure Remote Access** to machines (like servers)
* **Secure File Transfer** (with tools like `scp` and `sftp`)
* **Secure Command Execution** on remote machines
* **Port Forwarding / Tunneling**
* **Secure Git Communication** with platforms like GitHub

---

## 🛡 Why SSH?

Before SSH, protocols like Telnet sent information in **plain text**, making them easy targets for attackers to intercept passwords and commands. SSH solved this by **encrypting** the session, making it secure.

---

## ⚙️ How SSH Works (Architecture)

SSH uses **client-server** architecture:

### 🔸 SSH Client

* Installed on the local machine (e.g., your laptop)
* Initiates the connection

### 🔸 SSH Server (`sshd`)

* Runs on the remote machine (e.g., Linux server)
* Listens on **port 22** by default
* Authenticates and allows secure access

---

## 🔐 Authentication Methods

SSH provides multiple authentication mechanisms:

### ✅ Username/Password

* Basic method
* Not recommended for production environments alone

### ✅ Public Key Authentication (Recommended)

* Uses a **key pair**:

  * **Private Key** (kept secret on the client)
  * **Public Key** (stored on the server in `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`)
* Provides **strong security** and is widely used in automation

### ✅ Other Methods

* Host-based authentication
* Two-factor Authentication (2FA)
* Certificate-based Authentication

---

## 📄 SSH Key Generation

Generate a key pair on your machine:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

### 📂 Saves Keys To:

* **Private Key**: `~/.ssh/id_rsa`
* **Public Key**: `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`

### 📥 Copy Public Key to Server

```bash
ssh-copy-id user@remote-server
```

## 🔧 Basic SSH Commands

| Task                  | Command Example                             |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Connect to server     | `ssh user@hostname_or_ip`                   |
| Copy file to remote   | `scp file.txt user@remote:/path`            |
| Copy file from remote | `scp user@remote:/path/file.txt .`          |
| SSH with specific key | `ssh -i ~/.ssh/private_key user@host`       |
| Port forwarding       | `ssh -L local_port:remote:port user@remote` |

---

## 🛡 SSH Security Best Practices

* Disable password login (`PasswordAuthentication no` in `sshd_config`)
* Use **firewalls** to limit access to port 22
* Use **Fail2Ban** or similar to prevent brute-force attacks
* Use **key-based authentication**
* Change default SSH port from 22 to a non-standard one (optional)

## 🌐 SSH Tunneling and Port Forwarding

SSH allows forwarding ports securely:

### 📌 Local Forwarding

Access remote service on your local machine:

```bash
ssh -L 8080:internal.server.com:80 user@remote.com
```

### 📌 Remote Forwarding

Make a local machine service available to remote.

### 📌 Dynamic Forwarding (SOCKS Proxy):

```bash
ssh -D 1080 user@remote.com
```

---

## 🖥 GUI over SSH

With SSH, you can also forward graphical applications (on Linux/Unix):

```bash
ssh -X user@remote-server
```

Or use **VNC** or **X11** over SSH.

---

## 🔑 Example SSH Configuration (`~/.ssh/config`)

For convenience, you can configure SSH:

```ini
Host myserver
  HostName example.com
  User sangamesh
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
  Port 2222
```

Now connect with:

```bash
ssh myserver
```
