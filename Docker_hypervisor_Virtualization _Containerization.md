## üìò What is a Hypervisor?

A **hypervisor** is software, firmware, or hardware that enables a single physical machine to run **multiple virtual machines (VMs)**. Each VM functions as an independent system with its own operating system and resources.

## üß© Why Use a Hypervisor?

Hypervisors enable:

- Efficient hardware utilization
- Running multiple OSes on one physical machine
- Isolation between environments (great for testing, development, and production)
- Virtual infrastructure for cloud platforms

Virtualizations
Virtualization allows you to run multiple virtual machines (VMs) or environments on a single physical machine, each functioning like a separate computer.
