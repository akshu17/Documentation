# Difference Between `git fetch` and `git pull` — 1 Minute Interview Answer

**“The main difference between `git fetch` and `git pull` is how they update your local branch.**

`git fetch` downloads the latest changes from the remote repository but does **not merge them** into your current branch. It simply updates your remote-tracking branches, allowing you to review changes before applying them.

`git pull`, on the other hand, is a combination of **fetch plus merge**. It downloads the changes and immediately merges them into your current branch, updating your working files automatically.

In short, `git fetch` is safer because it lets you review changes first, while `git pull` is faster because it updates your branch in one step.”**
