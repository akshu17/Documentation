# Pull Request (PR) Approval Process — 1 Minute Interview Answer

**“The Pull Request (PR) approval process is a structured workflow used to review and validate code before merging it into the main branch.**

First, a developer completes their work in a feature branch and creates a pull request to merge it into the target branch, usually `develop` or `main`.

Next, automated CI checks run, such as build validation, unit tests, and code quality checks. If those pass, team members review the code for correctness, readability, performance, and security.

If reviewers request changes, the developer updates the code and pushes new commits. Once all feedback is resolved and the required approvals are given, the PR is merged into the target branch.

Finally, the feature branch is deleted, and the changes move forward for testing or deployment.

This process ensures code quality, reduces bugs, and promotes collaboration across the team. Tools like GitHub help manage and enforce this workflow.”**
