# 📘 Version Control System (VCS)

A **Version Control System (VCS)** is a tool that helps you **track and
manage changes** to files over time. It is commonly used in software
development but can be applied to any project involving evolving files.

It allows you to view history, revert changes, collaborate with others,
and maintain multiple versions of a project safely.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🎯 Why Use Version Control?

-   Track every change made to files\
-   Restore previous versions if something goes wrong\
-   Collaborate with multiple people easily\
-   Maintain complete project history\
-   Experiment using branches without affecting the main project

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🧠 How It Works (Simple Idea)

Instead of saving files like:

project_final_v1\
project_final_v2\
project_final_FINAL

Version control stores all versions in one system and tracks what
changed, when, and by whom.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🧩 Types of Version Control Systems

### 1️⃣ Local Version Control

-   Versions stored on one computer\
-   Simple but limited collaboration

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 2️⃣ Centralized Version Control

-   One central server stores all versions\
-   Users connect to update or download files\
-   Requires network access

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 3️⃣ Distributed Version Control (Most Popular)

-   Every user has a full copy of the repository\
-   Works offline\
-   Faster and more secure\
-   Widely used in modern development

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🌐 Popular Version Control Platforms

-   GitHub -- Popular for open-source and collaboration\
-   GitLab -- Integrated DevOps and CI/CD features\
-   Bitbucket -- Common in enterprise teams\
-   Apache Subversion (SVN) -- Centralized version control system
