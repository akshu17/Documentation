# Types of Branches in a Software Project

In most software development projects, teams use multiple types of branches to organize work, manage releases, and maintain stable production code. Many teams follow a structure similar to Git Flow.

---

## 1. Main / Master Branch

**Purpose:** Production-ready code

* Contains stable and tested code
* Always deployable
* Direct commits are usually restricted
* Code is merged only after review and testing

This branch represents the live application.

---

## 2. Develop Branch

**Purpose:** Integration branch for ongoing development

* All completed features are merged here
* Used for testing combined changes
* May not always be production-ready

This branch represents the next release under development.

---

## 3. Feature Branch

**Purpose:** Develop new features

* Created from the develop branch
* One branch per feature
* Merged back into develop after completion

**Examples**

* feature/login-page
* feature/payment-integration

Keeps new work isolated from stable code.

---

## 4. Bugfix Branch

**Purpose:** Fix bugs found during development

* Usually created from develop
* Merged back into develop after fixing

**Example**

* bugfix/header-alignment

Used for non-critical fixes before release.

---

## 5. Hotfix Branch

**Purpose:** Urgent fixes for production issues

* Created from main
* Fix applied immediately
* Merged back into both main and develop

**Example**

* hotfix/payment-crash

Used when production is broken and needs immediate repair.

---

## 6. Release Branch

**Purpose:** Prepare code for a new release

* Created from develop
* Only bug fixes and testing allowed
* Merged into main and develop after release

**Example**

* release/v1.2.0

Helps stabilize code before deployment.

---

## 7. Experimental / Spike Branch (Optional)

**Purpose:** Testing ideas or research

* Temporary branch
* May or may not be merged

**Example**

* experiment/new-ui-design

Used for trying new approaches safely.

---

## Typical Branch Flow

feature / bugfix → develop → release → main
hotfix → main → develop

---

## Why Use Multiple Branch Types?

* Safe development environment
* Organized workflow
* Parallel work by teams
* Controlled releases
* Quick emergency fixes

## Summary

| Branch Type  | Purpose                        |
| ------------ | ------------------------------ |
| Main         | Production-ready code          |
| Develop      | Ongoing development            |
| Feature      | New functionality              |
| Bugfix       | Fix development issues         |
| Hotfix       | Urgent production fixes        |
| Release      | Prepare version for deployment |
| Experimental | Testing ideas                  |

Using structured branching helps teams manage code efficiently, reduce errors, and maintain a stable production environment.
