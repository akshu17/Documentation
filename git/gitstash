# Git Stash — Explanation & Commands

`git stash` is used to **temporarily save uncommitted changes** so you can switch branches or work on something else without committing unfinished work.

It acts like a **temporary storage (shelf)** for your changes.

---

## 🧠 Why Use `git stash`?

Use stash when you have changes but need to:

* Switch branches
* Pull latest code
* Fix an urgent bug
* Pause current work without committing

Instead of committing incomplete code, you can stash it and restore it later.

## 📦 What Happens When You Stash?

```
Working directory → saved in stash → working directory becomes clean
```

Your files revert to the last committed state.
