# Git Branching Strategies

Git branching strategies define **how teams create, manage, and merge branches** in a repository.
They help coordinate development, maintain stable releases, and enable collaboration without conflicts.

## 🌿 1. Git Flow (Structured Workflow)

A formal and structured branching model often used in large projects.

### Main branches

* **main (or master)** → production-ready code
* **develop** → integration branch for ongoing development

### Supporting branches

* **feature/** → new features (from develop)
* **release/** → prepare a release (stabilization, testing)
* **hotfix/** → urgent production fixes (from main)

### Workflow

1. Create feature branches from develop.
2. Merge completed features back into develop.
3. Create a release branch to prepare deployment.
4. Merge release into main and develop.
5. Use hotfix branches for urgent production fixes.

### Best suited for

* Large teams
* Scheduled releases
* Strong testing and QA processes

## 🌱 2. GitHub Flow (Simple & Continuous)

A lightweight workflow focused on continuous deployment.

Used widely in modern web development and agile teams.

### Structure

* One long-lived branch → **main**
* Short-lived feature branches for all work

### Workflow

1. Create a branch from main.
2. Make changes and commit.
3. Open a pull request for review and testing.
4. Merge into main.
5. Deploy immediately.

### Best suited for

* Fast iteration
* Continuous deployment
* Small to medium teams
* Web applications

Originally popularized by **GitHub**.

## 🌳 3. GitLab Flow (Environment-Based)

Combines structure with continuous delivery using environment branches.

### Typical branches

* main
* staging
* production

Code moves forward through deployment environments rather than release branches.

### Best suited for

* DevOps pipelines
* Teams with staging environments
* Continuous delivery with controlled releases

Popularized by **GitLab**.

---

## 🔀 4. Trunk-Based Development (High Integration)

All developers work off a single branch (the trunk), usually main.

### Key principles

* Very short-lived feature branches
* Frequent merges
* Strong automated testing
* Feature flags for incomplete work

### Best suited for

* High-performing engineering teams
* CI/CD-driven development
* Microservices architecture

---

## 🌿 5. Release Branching (Version Maintenance)

Used when maintaining multiple versions of software simultaneously.

### Example branches

* main
* release/1.0
* release/2.0

Each version can receive independent bug fixes and support.

### Best suited for

* Enterprise software
* Libraries and frameworks
* Long-term support (LTS) products

## 🧭 Choosing the Right Strategy

| Team / Project Type         | Recommended Strategy       |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Solo developer              | GitHub Flow                |
| Startup / fast releases     | GitHub Flow or Trunk-Based |
| Enterprise / heavy QA       | Git Flow                   |
| CI/CD with environments     | GitLab Flow                |
| Multiple supported versions | Release Branching          |

## 🧠 Quick Summary

* Need structure and controlled releases → **Git Flow**
* Need simplicity and fast deployment → **GitHub Flow**
* Need environment-based delivery → **GitLab Flow**
* Need rapid integration and CI/CD → **Trunk-Based Development**
* Need multiple maintained versions → **Release Branching**
