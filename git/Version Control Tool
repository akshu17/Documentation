# Version Control Tool — Markdown Notes

## What is a Version Control Tool?

A **Version Control System (VCS)** is software that helps track, manage, and organize changes to files over time — especially source code.

It allows you to:

* Track changes
* Restore previous versions
* Collaborate with team members
* Manage multiple versions of a project safely

---

## Why Version Control is Important

Without version control:

* Files get overwritten accidentally
* Collaboration becomes difficult
* No history of changes
* Hard to restore older versions

With version control:

* Every change is recorded
* Easy team collaboration
* Safe experimentation using branches
* Ability to roll back to previous versions

---

## Key Features

### 1. Version History

Records:

* Who made changes
* When changes were made
* What was changed

### 2. Collaboration

Multiple developers can work on the same project simultaneously.

### 3. Branching

Create separate working versions of a project to develop features independently.

### 4. Merging

Combine changes from different branches into one version.

### 5. Rollback / Restore

Revert to previous versions if something breaks.

## Types of Version Control Systems

### Local Version Control

Tracks changes on a single computer.

### Centralized Version Control (CVCS)

* One central server stores project files
* Users connect to the server
* Requires internet connection

### Distributed Version Control (DVCS)

* Every user has a full repository copy
* Works offline
* Faster and more secure

---

## Popular Version Control Platforms

* GitHub
* GitLab
* Bitbucket

---

## Benefits of Version Control

* Tracks project history
* Prevents data loss
* Improves teamwork
* Enables safe testing
* Supports large projects

---

## Real-World Uses

* Software development
* Web development
* Data science projects
* Documentation management
* Design collaboration

---

## Summary

A version control tool is a system that records file changes, manages collaboration, and helps maintain project history safely and efficiently.
