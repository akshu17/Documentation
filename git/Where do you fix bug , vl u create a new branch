# Bug Fix Workflow in Git (Development vs Production)

This guide explains **where to fix bugs**, whether to create a new branch, and how bug fixes are managed in the next release.

---

## 1. Bug Found During Development (Not Released Yet)

If the bug exists in code that has **not been deployed to production**, fix it using a **bugfix branch**.

### Step 1 — Create a bugfix branch from develop

```bash
git checkout develop
git pull
git checkout -b bugfix/<bug-name>
```

---

### Step 2 — Fix the bug and commit changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix <bug description>"
```

---

### Step 3 — Merge bugfix branch into develop

```bash
git checkout develop
git merge bugfix/<bug-name>
```

(Optional) delete the branch:

```bash
git branch -d bugfix/<bug-name>
```

---

### Step 4 — Included in the next release

When a release branch is created from develop, the bug fix is automatically included.

No additional steps are required.

---

## 2. Bug Found in Production (Live Application)

If the bug affects users in production, fix it using a **hotfix branch**.

This allows immediate repair without waiting for the next release cycle.

---

### Step 1 — Create hotfix branch from main

```bash
git checkout main
git pull
git checkout -b hotfix/<bug-name>
```

---

### Step 2 — Fix the bug and commit

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix production issue"
```

---

### Step 3 — Merge into main and deploy immediately

```bash
git checkout main
git merge hotfix/<bug-name>
```

Deploy the updated version to production.

---

### Step 4 — Merge the same fix into develop

This ensures the bug does not reappear in the next release.

```bash
git checkout develop
git merge hotfix/<bug-name>
```

---

### Step 5 — Delete hotfix branch

```bash
git branch -d hotfix/<bug-name>
```

---

## 3. How Bug Fixes Are Managed in Future Releases

| Bug Location | Branch Used                | Included in Next Release? |
| ------------ | -------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Development  | bugfix branch from develop | Yes (already in develop)  |
| Production   | hotfix branch from main    | Yes (merged into develop) |

---

## 4. Important Rule

Always merge production hotfixes into develop.

If you skip this step, the bug may return in the next release.

---

## 5. Typical Bug Fix Flow

### Development Bug

bugfix branch → merge into develop → included in next release

### Production Bug

hotfix branch → merge into main → deploy
hotfix branch → merge into develop → future releases safe

---

## 6. Best Practices

* Never fix bugs directly in main or develop
* Always create a dedicated branch
* Merge fixes into the correct base branch
* Sync production fixes with develop
* Delete temporary branches after merging

---

## 7. Quick Summary

* Development bugs → fix in bugfix branch → merge into develop
* Production bugs → fix in hotfix branch → merge into main and develop
* Future releases come from develop, so keep it updated

This workflow ensures stable production and clean release management.
