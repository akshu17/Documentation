# README File — Markdown Notes

## What is a README File?

A **README file** is a document that explains what a project is, how it works, and how to use it.
It is usually the **first file users read** when they open a project repository.

Most projects place it in the root directory and name it:

```
README.md
```

The `.md` extension means it is written in **Markdown format**.

## Why README is Important
